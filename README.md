# REACT ESSENTIALS

Project Description:

This repository contains a simple exercise app developed by following the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)</a>

Everything you'll see inside here isn't mine, I've developed it by following video after video what <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/">Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller</a> teached inside his course.
It's amazing, follow him!
